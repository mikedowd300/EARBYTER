# EARBYTER
The EarByter API was created for developers who needed to incorporate sounds into their applications. The difficulty in populating a sound API, though, is that there is an infinite amount of sounds. EarByter's solution to this is to be just as much a site for non-developer users who want to listen to and upload sounds as it is a site where developers can use those sounds. In fact, the success of EarByter is in increasing users because users = sounds and sounds = robust API.

There are essentially 4 views in the application: Landing Page, API docs, Members Page, Admin Page.

On the landing page anybody can search and listen to sounds, as well as click to copy the URL of the sound for sharing via text and email. Included on this page are featured sounds, which are sounds that, for one reason or another the administrator chose to feature. In the future, the process for selecting which sounds to feature could be more dynamic, there could be up-votes, or a viral-sound tracker or even featured-sounds customized to a particular users taste. Also included on this page are featured Sites which are sites that use the EarByter API.

The API docs is where a developer would go to get information about the API including different routes based on different search criteria, sample output from the API and sample HTML and JavaScript demonstrating how a developer might incorporate the information into an application.

The members page is for users who have signed up for an account. On their page is a search bar, as on the landing page, a list of sounds for which the user is the author, a form for submitting sounds to the cloud and, if the user is a developer, a form for the submission of URLs for featuring candidates on the landing page. It is hoped that this last feature would encourage developers to become members and use the API so that their sites would have a backlink for SEO purposes. It is also a possibility that users whose sounds are used on an API will get notification of when their sound has been used on a site and how many "listens" in has recieved.

From the Admin Page the administrator can list all URLs submitted as candidates and chose to feature them or unfeature them. The administrator can also do this for sounds. Another feature on this page is the administrators abiity to see the total amount of memory used in the database. In the future a feature could be added where the admin could see, on a user-by-user basis, how much memory is being used.
